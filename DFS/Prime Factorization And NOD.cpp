It is possible to find NOD(Number of Divisors) from prime factorization of N. Suppose N=12. 
Its prime factorization is 2^2Ã—3. Is it possible to divide 12 with 5? 
No. Cause the prime factorization of 12 does not contain 5. We can divide N with primes that appear in factorization of N.
Next, can we divide 12 with 2^3? No. The power of 2 in prime factorization of 12 is 2^2. 
So we cannot divide 12 with 2^3, since 2^2 is not divisible by 23.
